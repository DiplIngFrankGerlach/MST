<h1>The Minimal Secure Transport Protocol</h1>
By Dipl. Ing.(BA) Frank Gerlach (frankgerlach.tai@gmx.de)
<p>
The MST protocol has been designed in order to create a building block for a 
more secure computing landscape. The main design objective has been simplicity,
which directly translates into high security, because simple programs are 
also easy to review and even prove correct in a mathematic sense.
</p>

<h1>Which Assurances Are Provided By MST ?</h1>
Similar to SSL/TLS, MST assures that
<list>
  <li>messages are obfuscated</li>
  <li>messages cannot be replayed by an attacker</li>
  <li>messages cannot be modified by an attacker</li>
  <li>messages cannot be constructed by an attacker</li>
  <li>identical messages do not encrypt to identical ciphertext</li>
  <li>macro structures in the plaintext are invisible in ciphertext</li>
</list>
  
<h1>Does MST Provide Asymmetric Cipher Functionality ?</h1>
For the sake of simplicity (which translates into security), only
symmetric ciphers (AES) are used. The transfer of symmetric keys
is well understood even by novice users and it is possible to 
use tools such as GPG/PGP for the purpose of key dissemination.



<h1>Why not use existing Protocols like SSL/TLS or SSH ?</h1>

<p>
These protocols are highly complex and consequently require complex library code
in order to realize the protocols. OpenSSL is at 400k lines of code and 
had a large number of remotely exploitable bugs. Libraries of this size
are very hard to review or prove correct. Even the "compact" TLS 
implementation "s2n" of Amazon still has 27000 lines of code.
</p>


<p>
MST has less than 400 lines of code (not counting the AES cipher which is used
for encrpytion and hashing). This easily allows for review and correctness
proofs are economically possible.

<h1>Licensing, Consulting</h1>

<p>
MST is free for non-commercial use, but requires a license in other cases.
Licenses start at $50 per CPU core. For more details, please send
and email to frankgerlach.tai@gmx.de.
