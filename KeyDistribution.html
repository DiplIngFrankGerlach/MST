<h1>Methods For Symmetric Key Distribution</h1>

<p>By Dipl. Ing.(BA) Frank Gerlach (frankgerlach.tai@gmx.de)</p>

This paper will discuss various methods for the distribution of symmetric keys
from centralized server systems to the users of the server/service. I take 
a pragmatic approach instead of a technology-driven one. Overly complex
technologies have proven to be faulty in their implementation.

<h2>Structure of a symmetric key</h2>
A symmetric key is typically between 128 and 256 bits of random number. This
can be encoded in 32 to 64 hexadecimal characters. 

<h2>1. Postal System/Letters</h2>

Modern society has been trusting the postal system for at least 100 years
with the communication of confidential information such as bank 
statements, lawyer's letters, insurance policies and the like.
This means that it would be an acceptable risk to also 
use the postal system for transport of symmetric keys used for
banking, insurance or communications with lawyers.

<h2>1.2 Postal Letter Key Transfer Details</h2>
As an additional security measure, keys transferred in postal letters should
be protected using 
<list>
  <li>sealed letters</li>
  <li>key-printouts which are protected with a rub-off-surface</li>
  <li>the paper used should use watermarks of the institution</li>
  <li>measures which prevent attacks based on powerful lights/x-rays shining through the sealed envelope</li>
  <li>thick papers for both envelope and the paper with the key itself</li>
</list>
Similar systems are already used by German banks for the purpose of communicating
Bank Account passwords to their customers. Note that actual transfer usually requires
additional factors such as TAN Generators or codes sent via mobile phone.


<h2>2. Key Distribution in Branch Offices, Pharmacies, MD's practice, Town Hall etc</h2>
Many if not most existing businesses and agencies have offices in the vicinity of the
user. A very secure way of handing out key material is to print it out in a branch office
and handing it over to customers. The customer is authenticated by presenting ID and/or
is personally known for years and does not need ID. Banks use this method for hundreds
of years now without major trust problems.

<h2>3. End User Authentication</h2>
For applications such as Banking, some postal services already offer User Authentication
Services. This means that the post offices can verify the identity of a person using
the person's ID documents. Receivers of the authentication procedure are banks,
insurance companies and similar institutions. In Germany this system is called
"PostIdent".

<h2>4. Kerberos</h2>

The Kerberos system is an example of a system for automatic symmetric key material distribution
from servers to client systems. Unfortunately, its implementations contained much
more exploitable bugs than acceptable.

<h2>5. Key Material Distribution Officers</h2>

<p>Banks, Firms, Government offices usually have sufficient personell in order to 
designate about 3 percent of personell as Key Material Distribution Officers
(KMDO). A KMDO will supply Key Material for other employees of the 
organisation, facilitating access to centralized systems such as 
Email, ERP, Accounting, File Sharing and all line-of-business applications.</p>

<p>The KMDO will use a Secure Messaging Application(SMA), which is only used for
communicating key Material. Unlike an Email system, it will be very simplistic
and thereby secure. For example, the message character set will be limited 
to numbers, alphabetic characters and a few select special characters.
The keys for the SMA itself will be communicated to the KMDO physically visiting
the KMDO service center.</p>

<h2>6. Courier</h2>
Communication of key material and cipher machines by Courier is a widely used
approach in the diplomatic sphere. It can easily be used by large firms or
government agencies in order to transfer key material.

<h2>7. Personal Contact And Acquaintance</h2>
