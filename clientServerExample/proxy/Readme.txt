This directory contains the MST proxy, which enables unsecured servers to
be secured using the MST protocol. 
The unsecured server must for this purpose expose the server port only locally.
Note that this can be ensured using a firewall like iptables or the windows
firewall.

Main programs:

proxyServer (runs on the server side)
proxyClient (runs on the client side)
